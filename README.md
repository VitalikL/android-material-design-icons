# Android Material Design Icons

Material Design Icons taken from official material design icons [repository](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons). 

## What's the difference

Icons have been sorted in a way so it is easy to integrate to your android project by copying drawable-* folder for each icon and pasting to Android Studio. 

A live [preview](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/)  of the icon set is available.
